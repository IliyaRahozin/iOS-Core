<h1 align="center"> iOS-Core </h1> 

<h3 align="center"> Kind of smart ü§¢ </h3>
For This roadmap is designed to guide an iOS developer from a Strong Junior level to a Middle+ level. It covers a comprehensive set of topics including RxSwift, UIKit, MVVM, Coordinator, TSA, SwiftUI, The Composable Architecture, Analytics, Attribution, In-App Purchases, and more. Each section provides resources for learning and practicing the relevant technologies.

<h3 align="center"> And now honestly üëπ </h3>
I decided to structure my training and systematize my progress. That's why I fucked everything here. I consider the resources that I add to be acceptable for real projects, and not bullshit written on the knee (which will also sometimes flash here, not without bullshit, as they say). Have fun, use it - honestly don't give a fuck, I hope it helps you
